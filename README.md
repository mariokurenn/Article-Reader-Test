# Article-Reader

Article-Reader is is a simple frontend application built using React, Typescript and Sass/SCSS.

When designing Article-Reader, a key consideration was to create a user-friendly and intuitive interface. To achieve this, a clean and organized layout was chosen, with articles displayed in a categorized and chronological order on the homepage. Categorization allows users to easily navigate and explore articles based on their interests, while chronological sorting ensures that the latest news is prominently featured.

Additionally, the decision to implement infinite scroll functionality in the latest news widget was made to provide a seamless browsing experience, eliminating the need for manual pagination. This design choice allows users to effortlessly scroll through articles, dynamically loading new content as they reach the end of the page.

The search filter feature was also implemented to empower users with the ability to search for specific articles by name, further enhancing their browsing experience and enabling them to find relevant content quickly. By prioritizing a user-centric approach in the design, Article-Reader aims to deliver a smooth and efficient news-reading experience.Furthermore, Article-Reader has undergone thorough testing and optimization to ensure a seamless user experience on mobile devices,

Article-Reader employs the power of the New York Times API to fetch real-time and authentic articles, providing you with a reliable and current newsfeed.

In addition to its features mentioned above, Article-Reader also leverages the capabilities of the browser's Local Storage to enhance the user experience. The application utilizes Local Storage for storing the state of bookmarked articles.

When a user bookmarks an article, the relevant data is saved to the Local Storage, allowing the application to remember the user's preferences even after closing and reopening the browser. This ensures that the bookmarked articles remain accessible and can be easily retrieved by the user whenever needed.
